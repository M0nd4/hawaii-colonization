A model-based Bayesian calibration using \rc\space data from
paleoenvironmental cores and materials introduced to the islands by
Polynesian colonists estimates that the islands were likely colonized
sometime late in the first millennium AD.  Two calibrations, one using
\rc\space dates on floral materials and the other using \rc\space
dates on floral and faunal materials, indicate that archaeological
materials yield relatively imprecise estimates of the colonization
event with 95% highest posterior density regions 3-5 centuries long.
Materials introduced to the islands by Polynesians date to two
periods, one that coincides with the colonization event, and another
some 3-6 centuries later.  A disparity between colonization
and the first reliably dated archaeological evidence of human activity
is identified and estimated to be 1-4 centuries long.

* Introduction

In the sixty years since an unexpectedly old age estimate was returned
by the first \rc\space date from Hawai`i
[[citep:libby51:_radioc_dates_ii]], archaeologists have used \rc\space
dating evidence to estimate when Polynesians first colonized the
islands.  Initially, the \rc\space method was seen as a precise
scientific replacement for the settlement dates derived from
traditional histories, which relied on genealogical information and
estimates of the average length of a generation to calculate when
Polynesians colonized the islands.  Somewhat surprisingly, the use of
\rc\space dating evidence has failed to yield a precise estimate.  In
fact, over time, it has produced a wider range of settlement estimates
than genealogical dating with all its vagaries.  Published estimates
based on \rc\space data now range from the beginning of the common era
[[citep:hunt-holsen91]] to the thirteenth century AD
[[citep:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]].  Much of this variability is due
to Hawaiian archaeologists' uncritical use of the \rc\space method, in
particular the on-going and explicable failure to control for the
effects of old wood [[citep:dye00:_effec, dye10:_age_o18_site_hawaii]].
Another important source of variability is the ad hoc methods used to
interpret \rc\space dates when estimating the colonization event.  A
model-based Bayesian approach is proposed here as a solution to this
persistent problem.

* A Brief Review of Ad Hoc Age Estimates for Polynesian Colonization

Archaeologists have developed three different approaches to estimating
when Polynesians colonized Hawai`i.  These include a search for early
sites, evaluations of lists of \rc\space dates compiled from site
excavation reports, and evaluations of \rc\space dates from
paleoenvironmental investigations.  All of these approaches have been
implemented in an ad hoc way, without benefit of an explicit
chronological model.

Early \rc\space -based estimates of Polynesian colonization of Hawai`i
were framed in the context of arguments for the ages of purportedly
early sites.  Arguments for an early establishment of three coastal
sites were made, including: Pu`u Ali`i, Site H1
[[citep:emory69:age_of_sites]]; Bellows, Site O18
[[citep:pearson71:_bellows]]; and the H\=alawa Valley Dune, Site
MO-A1-3 [[citep:kirch-kelly75:halawa]], which was interpreted as
somewhat later than the other two.  At each of the three sites
artifactual or structural evidence was found that differed from
expectations based on the known ethnographic and museum records and
which was interpreted as indicating some antiquity for the site: at
Pu`u Ali`i this was a multi-faceted sequence of change in various
types of fishing gear [[citep:emory68:_fishhooks]]; at Bellows an
artifact assemblage with an unusual shell coconut grater, pearl shell
fishhooks, and adzes with trapezoidal and triangular cross sections
[[citep:pearson71:_bellows]]; and at H\=alawa Valley, a buried
round-ended house, untanged and ground adzes, and various early
fishhook types [[citep:kirch-kelly75:halawa]].

The early age estimate for each of these sites was subsequently
challenged.  [[citet:dye92]] showed that the argument for an early
date at H1 was based on outliers among the dated samples and used an
analysis of cumulative probability curves to
argue for a much later fifteenth century date for establishment of the
site.  The O18 site was re-dated twice.  The first attempt yielded
somewhat equivocal results, which were interpreted as indicating a
later establishment of the site in the eighth century AD
[[citep:tuggle01:_age_bellow_dune_site_o18]].  The second attempt
yielded a stratigraphically consistent set of results that compare
favorably with other well-dated sites nearby and indicate that the
site was established in AD 1040-1219, some nine centuries later than
the earliest estimate of its age [[citep:dye10:_age_o18_site_hawaii]].
Six new AMS dates from contexts near the base of the H\=alawa Dune
site clearly indicate that the original basis for early settlement
there was an outlier, probably due to the old wood effect.  The site
is now believed to have been established in the fifteenth century AD
[[citep:kirch07:_recon_hawaiian_cultur_sequen]].

This situation led in the 1990s to development of an approach to
estimating the date of Polynesian colonization that doesn't rely on
identifying an early site.  In this approach, a corpus of \rc\space
dates is assembled, the dates are calibrated, and the early tail of
the temporal distribution of the calibrated ages is used to estimate
the age of colonization.  This is the approach used by
[[citet:hunt-holsen91]] and [[citet:graves95:_polyn_settl_of_hawaiian_archip]]
to argue that Hawai`i was discovered by Polynesians in the first to
fifth centuries AD.  At the time, this early colonization date
appeared to be supported by the colonization sequence in the Eastern
Polynesian homeland of Hawai`i, but subsequent \rc\space dating of
purportedly early sites there that controlled for the
effects of old wood
[[citep:rolett95:_renew_inves_haatuat_dune_nukuh_marques_islan,anderson02:_new_radioc_ages_colon_sites_east_polyn,wilmshurst08:_datin_polyn_new_zealan_pacif]]
has shown that the colonization sequence as it was understood in the
early 1990s was several centuries too early.  As a result, the
estimated colonization ages for Hawai`i based on corpora of \rc\space
dates were recognized as implausibly early.  In response to this
situation, [[citet*:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]] have developed a set
of criteria for accepting or rejecting individual \rc\space dates, an
approach known in the Pacific as "chronometric hygiene"
[[citep:spriggs-anderson93]], and have applied this to the problem of
estimating the colonization dates of island groups in East Polynesia,
including Hawai`i.  Using a substantially reduced corpus of
\rc\space dates, this approach yields an estimate that Polynesian
colonization of Hawai`i took place in AD 1219--1266.

A second response to the lack of early dated sites was to look outside
of archaeological sites for information that might be used to infer
when colonization took place.  Prominent examples of this approach
include [[citet:burney01:_fossil_eviden_for_diver_biota]] and
[[citep:athens02:_avifaun_extin_veget_chang_and]]. This approach yielded
especially useful results on the `Ewa Plain of O`ahu island, where
paleoenvironmental coring in Ordy Pond revealed a stratigraphic
sequence of thin layers, each of which represents a short interval of
time, and excavations in limestone sinkholes yielded apparently old
materials introduced to the islands by Polynesians.  Dates on
materials from the pre-colonization and post-colonization periods were
interpreted as supporting a settlement range of AD 700-800 [[citep:athens02:_avifaun_extin_veget_chang_and][57, n. 1]].
The model-based approach outlined below builds on this approach to
propose a solution to the problem of when Hawai`i was colonized by
Polynesians.

* Advantages of a Model-based Approach
The theory and practice of Bayesian calibration for the archaeologist
have been fully explicated by [[citet*:buck96]] and the interested reader
is enthusiastically referred to that volume for an in-depth treatment
of the topic.  In what follows the Bayesian approach to calibration is
summarized to draw out the contrast with ad hoc approaches in general,
and the approach used most recently by
[[citet:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]] in particular.

The archaeologist carrying out a Bayesian calibration has two tasks:
build a model that specifies the temporal relations among the events
of interest and incorporates any prior information on their ages, and
identify and collect dating information that fit into the model.  The
calibration itself, carried out in software such as BCal [[citep:bcal]] or
OxCal [[citep:ramsey95:oxcal]], uses the model to constrain the values
assigned to the calibrated ages of the samples during a probabilistic
resampling process that is designed to converge on the result that
would be obtained through direct analysis by a skilled statistician.

It is important to note that the Bayesian calibration doesn't test the
model in any meaningful sense.  Rather, Bayesian
calibration takes the model as a given set of facts and reports back
the best estimates of model parameters--the ages of archaeological
events of interest--in the light of the data collected for the model.
Bayesian model-building isn't an exercise in speculation or
imagination so much as it is an assessment of what is known about a
set of archaeological events and their relations to one another.
Typically, this assessment is based on excavation data where apt field
procedures ensure that archaeological events are identified and the
laws of stratification [[citep:harris89:_princ_archaeol_strat]],
conscientiously applied, provide the basis for ordering them
temporally.  The model need not have its basis in a stratigraphic
sequence, however, and all that is required is a clear statement about
the archaeological events of interest and their temporal relations to
one another.  When dating information is properly fit into a
reasonable model, the Bayesian calibration will yield archaeologically
interpretable results.  This is a strong claim.  It can be made
because the modeling process explicitly specifies the relationship at
the heart of any successful dating project---the relationship between
the dated event and the archaeological event of interest.

This model building step is ignored in the ad hoc interpretations,
which don't specify the relationship of dated events to the
colonization event.  This can be clearly seen in the recent article by
[[citet*:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]].
#+BEGIN_quote
Our main objective is to establish the most accurate age, or ages, for
initial colonization in East Polynesia. To accomplish this, it is
necessary to be conservative in evaluating the usefulness of
data. That is, to accept only those dates that (i) are clearly and
directly linked to cultural activity, (ii) have the fewest intrinsic
sources of potential error (e.g., from inbuilt age, dietary, or
postdepositional contamination by old carbon), and (iii) are capable
of providing a calibration that is close to the “true” age of the
actual target event (i.e., human activity).  [[citep:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]]
#+END_quote
Here, the dates are carefully chosen from a pool of potential dates to
ensure that they are reliably associated with "cultural activity" (or
"human activity"), but without regard to how these activities are
related to the colonization event.
# [fn::The item (iii) in their list
# has no obvious meaning and appears to be based, at least in part, on
# an idiosyncratic and vague definition of accuracy, which is defined as
# "based on those samples that can provide a date that is the `true' age
# of the sample within the statistical limits of the date"
# [[citep:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]]]

Instead of modeling the relationship between the dated events and
Polynesian colonization, an assumption is made that the early tail of
the empirical calibrated age distribution of a selected sample of age
determinations equates to the colonization event.
[[citet:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]] investigate this tail closely and
propose two methods related conceptually to the /floruit/
[[citep:ottoway73:disperson_diagrams]] to estimate the age of the earliest
human activity represented in the corpus of \rc\space dates.  With the
sample of \rc\space dates selected from Hawai`i, this method yields a
range of AD 1219--1266.  But the method does nothing to ensure that
the human activity represented by the sample has any association with
the colonization event.  A moment's reflection is enough to convince
oneself that there are very many samples that could be drawn from a
population of \rc\space dates for which the early tail of the
empirical calibrated age distribution will not equate to the
colonization event.  How can one distinguish which samples do and
which don't?  [[citet:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]] note that their
estimates for New Zealand and Rapa Nui coincide with colonization
estimates derived by other means, but these coincidences carry no
information about the association between dated events and
colonization at the other island groups. The ad hoc interpretive
schemes have no answer for the fundamental question of association.
The results of their analyses require a leap of faith that the early
tail of an empirical calibrated date distribution is associated with
the colonization event. The leap of faith required by this ad hoc
inferential procedure contrasts strongly with a Bayesian calibration,
which explicitly models the relationship between dated and target
events, and which yields a probability distribution for the
colonization event based on a well-defined and thoroughly tested
statistical method [[citep:buck96]].

* A Bayesian Estimate of Polynesian Colonization 

A Bayesian model to estimate the Polynesian colonization of Hawai`i
can be simple.  It establishes two periods, one for the period
before the islands were colonized by Polynesians and one for the
period after the colonization event.  If the beginning and end of the
pre-colonization period are represented by \alpha_pre and \beta_pre,
respectively, and the beginning and end of the post-colonization
period likewise represented by \alpha_post and \beta_post, then the
model can be summarized as follows:
\begin{equation}
\infty = \alpha_{pre} > \beta_{pre} = \alpha_{post} > \beta_{post} = 0
\end{equation} where $>$ means, "is older than" and numbers express
years before present.  The parameters of interest in this model are
\beta_pre and \alpha_post, which the model indicates are equal; the
colonization event simultaneously ended the pre-colonization period
and began the post-colonization period.  The other two parameters are
known.  The main Hawaiian Islands are geologically young, 0.4--5 mya,
but much older than the effective range of the \rc\space method.  The
age of \alpha_pre is essentially infinite.  Likewise, \beta_post, the
end of the post-colonization period, is 0 BP, which by convention in
\rc\space dating is AD 1950 [[citep:stuiver-polach77]].

\rc\space dating material from pre-colonization period deposits is
rarely, if ever, collected during archaeological excavations.  In
part, this is due the nature of the "sterile," which in many cases is
a mineral subsoil that lacks macroscopic organic inclusions.  In other
situations, such as calcareous beach sand deposits, there is abundant
organic material but it is not possible to relate its age to the
overlying cultural deposit or to the colonization event. In caves or
sinkholes, where natural deposition processes laid down organic
materials before the onset of cultural deposition, it is sometimes
possible to distinguish pre-colonization deposits from natural
post-colonization deposits based on changes in floral and faunal
materials and the absence of introduced taxa in lower levels of the
excavations [[citep:burney01:_fossil_eviden_for_diver_biota]].  Mixing of
deposits is a pervasive problem in many sinkholes, however
[[citep:athens02:_avifaun_extin_veget_chang_and]].  In contrast,
paleoenvironmental coring on the older, northern islands of O`ahu and
Kaua`i has consistently revealed a pattern of sediments with charcoal
overlying sediments that lack charcoal.  The charcoal in these cores
has been attributed to human activities because, it is argued, the two
causes of natural fires---volcanism and lightning strikes---were
either absent or extremely rare on the northern islands.  Organic
material from the charcoal-free lower layers of several
paleoenvironmental cores has been dated, with results that are older
than the oldest dated materials from archaeological deposits.
Paleoenvironmental coring investigations on O`ahu Island at Ordy Pond
yielded a finely divided stratigraphic profile with organic material
from a charcoal-free stratum near the boundary marking the onset of
charcoal deposition [[citep:zathens-ward-tuggle-welch99]].  The date on an
unidentified seed, Beta-83313, is the youngest \rc\space date from a
pre-colonization period deposit (table \ref{tab:colonization-dates}).

\rc\space dates from the post-colonization period are all on materials
believed to have been introduced to the islands by Polynesians (table
\ref{tab:colonization-dates}).  The \rc\space dates chosen for analysis are
the oldest known for each of the dated materials.  These include: a
bone of the Polynesian rat, /Rattus exulans/; a nutshell of the
/kukui/ tree, /Aleurites moluccana/; a charred fragment of a
tentatively identified sweet potato tuber, /Ipomoea batatas/; wood
charcoal identified as breadfruit, /Artocarpus altilis/; a piece of
gourd, /Lagenaria siceraria/; and wood charcoal identified as /k\=\i/,
/Cordyline fruticosa/.  Barring the rather unlikely possibility that
one or more of these dated materials was brought to Hawai`i from the
homeland by the first colonists, they cannot be older than the
colonization event because they were unknown in Hawai`i during the
pre-colonization period.  They can be confidently assigned to the
post-colonization period regardless of the archaeological contexts
from which they derived.

Analyses of mtDNA indicate that the bones of commensal animals can be
used to trace human migration patterns in the Pacific
[[citep:matisoo-smith94:_rat_dna,matisoo-smith98:_human_mobility]].
Because rats multiply rapidly once introduced to an island they
provide a visible archaeological signal of colonization.
Archaeologists have demonstrated that \rc\space dates on rat bones can
serve as an effective proxy for the age of the colonization event
[[citep:wilmshurst08:_datin_polyn_new_zealan_pacif]].  In Hawai`i,
rats introduced by the first Polynesian colonists are believed
responsible for many of the environmental changes that characterize
the early post-colonization period
[[citep:athens02:_avifaun_extin_veget_chang_and]].  There are several
old rat bone dates from sinkholes on the `Ewa Plain.  The oldest of
these, CAMS-25560, was collected from Site 5108-F1 [[citep:athens02:_avifaun_extin_veget_chang_and][72]], and was
pre-treated prior to dating using the XAD resin processing protocol
[[citep:stafford91:_molecular]].  Apparently, there was no control for the
possible effects of dietary uptake of carbon depleted in ^{14}C, as
would be the case if there were a marine component to the rat diet
[[citep:beavan98:_factor_rats]].  Although [[citet:wilmshurst08:_datin_polyn_new_zealan_pacif][7678]] found no evidence for a
marine component in the diet of 30 rat bones analyzed from New
Zealand, [[citet:richards09:_isotop_analy_human_animal_diets]] detected a
marine influence on the diet of rats at the Hanamiai site.  The
possibility that such an effect is present in the dated bones from the
`Ewa Plain can't be discounted.  Thus, the \rc\space age estimate for
CAMS-25560, along with the other \rc\space age estimates on rat bone
might be older than their true ages.  If present, however, the
disjunctions are not great enough to yield implausibly old age
estimates; all of the \rc\space age estimates on rat bone are likely
younger than the oldest dated /kukui/ nutshell.
  
Nutshells of the /kukui/ tree, /Aleurites moluccana/, are a common
component of archaeological sites, typically as readily-identifiable
charred fragments.  Introduced to the islands by Polynesian colonists,
the tree is now "a conspicuous component of mesic valley vegetation,
0--700 m, on all of the main islands except Kaho`olawe" [[citep:wagner90][598]].  Its
presence in small hanging valleys of cliff faces, where the nuts could
not have dispersed naturally, suggests that the nuts were "sown"
during traditional Hawaiian times [[citep:ziegler02:_hawaiian_natur_histor_ecolog_evolut][330]].  Most of the \rc\space dates on
/kukui/ nutshell are relatively recent, but one, Beta-20852b, from
Layer II of the Bellows Dune Site O18
[[citep:tuggle01:_age_bellow_dune_site_o18,dye10:_age_o18_site_hawaii]] ,
is the oldest dated Polynesian introduction.  It was recovered from
the upper cultural layer of the site and was 700-800 years old when it
was deposited [[citep:dye10:_age_o18_site_hawaii]].

The sweet potato was introduced to Polynesia from America
[[citep:yen74:_sweet_potato]] probably in the eleventh to twelfth
centuries AD [[citep:green05:_sweet_potato]].  It was likely a secondary
introduction to Hawai`i
[[citep:hommon76:_format_primit_states_pre_contac_hawaii]]. Material
identified as carbonized sweet potato tuber is occasionally recovered
from archaeological sites in Hawai`i.  Two pieces have been dated
[[citep:ladefoged05:_introd_of_sweet_potat_in_polyn]].  The dated sample
used in this analysis, Beta-208143, the older of the two, was
collected from a trench near the seaward edge of the Leeward Kohala
Field System in the land of Kahua-1.  The sample was tentatively
identified as sweet potato due to its small size and lack of
diagnostic characters.


According to Hawaiian tradition, breadfruit was also a secondary
introduction to the islands after the fourteenth century AD [[citep:handy72:native_planters][149--155]].
The Hawaiian breadfruit, like other breadfruit cultivars in eastern
Polynesia, is seedless and is propagated vegetatively
[[citep:zerega04:_compl_origin_bread_morac]]. It has not become
naturalized in Hawai`i [[citep:wagner90][14]].  It was planted in groves in the Kona Field
System [[citep:allen04:_bet][215]], but elsewhere plantings tended to be solitary.  Breadfruit
is not short-lived, so it is rarely dated in archaeological situations
where the dated event must be closely associated with the target
event.  The sample included in this analysis, NOSAMS-0809-26, was
collected from an irrigated pondfield sediment of Layer V at Site
26086 in Halawa Ahupua`a, North Kohala
[[citep:mccoy10:_introd_bread_hawaiian_islan]].  In this context the
sample probably represents secondary deposition of older material
brought into the pondfield with irrigation water
[[citep:allen92:_farmin_hawaii_colon_contac]].  It is thus somewhat
problematic for dating the use of the pondfield sediment in Layer V,
but the identification as /A. altilis/ ensures that it belongs to the
post-colonization period and is thus useful for the analysis at hand.

The bottle gourd, /Lagenaria siceraria/, appears to have been
introduced to Eastern Polynesia from South America along with the
sweet potato in the eleventh or twelfth century AD
[[citep:green00:_range_discip_suppor_dual_origin]]. It would thus likely
have been a secondary introduction to Hawai`i.  Uncharred pieces of
the gourd are sometimes recovered from dry contexts with good
preservation.  The sample, Beta-135126, consisted of uncharred gourd
fragments recovered from the floor of cave Site 50--10--31--21286 at
Pohakuloa [[citep:williams02:_ecosy_manag_progr_cultur_resour][Fig. 10a]], a high altitude desert used traditionally by bird
hunters [[citep:athens91:bird_hunters]].  Site 21286 had a sparse deposit;
the only material collected appears to have been the gourd fragments.


The /k\=\i/, /Cordyline terminalis/, is a shrub that was transported
widely in prehistory [[citep:wagner90][1348]].  The green-leaved variety transported to
Eastern Polynesia and Hawai`i by Polynesians is sterile, perhaps a
result of cultural selection in Western Polynesia for "improved
portability, rhizome flavor or texture, increased ecological tolerance
or size, or other characteristics that sterility could potentially
confer" [[citep:hinkle07:_popul_struc_pacif][834]].  The leaves are sometimes recovered from pit ovens and
the charred wood is occasionally identified in the charcoal from
fires.  The sample used in this analysis, Beta-233041, was recovered
from an abandoned taro pondfield in lower Halawa, North Kohala [[citep:mccoy10:_role_agric_innov_pacif_islan][101]].


Given the possibility that the rat bone dates from the `Ewa Plain are
too old due to the uncontrolled effects of a marine component in the
diet, the model was first calibrated without them, the
post-colonization period represented by dates on introduced flora.
This model can then be expressed as in (\ref{eq:no-rat}).  The
model and data were calibrated with the BCal software package
[[citep:bcal]].  The posterior probability of the colonization event,
\alpha_post, has a 95% highest posterior density (HPD) region of AD
810-1289 and a mode at AD 980 (fig. \ref{fig:no-rat}, \textit{left}).

\begin{equation}
\infty = \alpha_{pre} > \theta_{1} > \beta_{pre} = \alpha_{post} >
\theta_{2-6} > \beta_{post} = 0
\label{eq:no-rat}
\end{equation}

The estimate yielded by the model of (\ref{eq:no-rat}) is
relatively imprecise; the oldest date, Beta-20852b on /kukui/
nutshell, has a standard deviation of 230 \rc\space years and the next
oldest date, NOSAMS-0809-26 on breadfruit charcoal, is several hundred
years younger.  The floral evidence for the early end of the
post-colonization period is, thus, relatively weak and the calibration
produces a posterior probability for \alpha_post that is skewed to the
right.

If the age of the earliest rat bone from the `Ewa Plain is accepted,
then the model can be expressed as (\ref{eq:rat}).  The
addition of earliest rat bone date, CAMS-25560, fills a gap between
the early date on /kukui/ nutshell and the next-oldest date on
breadfruit.  When (\ref{eq:rat}) is calibrated with BCal
the posterior probability of \alpha_post has a 95% HPD region of AD
780-1119 with a mode at AD 960 (fig. \ref{fig:no-rat}, \textit{right}).

    :END:

The ad hoc estimate of AD 1219--1266
[[citep:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]] appears almost certainly to be too
late.  The probability that AD 1219 is later than the colonization
event estimated by (\ref{eq:no-rat}) is 0.89, and for the estimate
yielded by (\ref{eq:rat}) it is greater than 0.99.  One reason for
this disparity is the ad hoc method used by
[[citet:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]], which doesn't specify the
relationships between the dated events and Polynesian colonization of
Hawai`i.  Another reason is the decision to exclude from analysis
\rc\space dates whose standard error is greater than ten percent of
the conventional radiocarbon age.  One casualty of this decision is
the date on /kukui/ nutshell, Beta-20852b, which is perhaps the oldest
dated material introduced by Polynesians known from Hawai`i.  The ad
hoc method cannot sensibly interpret the large standard deviation of
this age determination, 230 \rc\space years, and the long early tail
it would create for the probability distributions.  This, however, is a
failing of the ad hoc method and not of the age determination, which
carries information about when Polynesians colonized Hawai`i.  It is
useful, in this light, to compare how this age determination is
incorporated into the Bayesian analysis.

The first thing to note is that the \rc\space age of the /kukui/
nutshell is older than the dated seed from the pre-colonization period
deposit in Ordy Pond.  Because (\ref{eq:no-rat}) and
(\ref{eq:rat}) both specify that the pre-colonization period is older
than and abuts the post-colonization period, the Bayesian calibration
will not consider a scenario in which the true age of the /kukui/
nutshell is older than the true age of the seed from Ordy pond.  The
practical effect of this constraint is that the posterior probability
for \theta_1 will shift to the left and that for \theta_4 will shift
to the right.  This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:interpretable},
which shows the results of an unconstrained calibration of the two
\rc\space dates in the top two panels, and the Bayesian calibration of
(\ref{eq:no-rat}) in the bottom two panels.  As can be seen
in the figure, the posterior probabilities of \theta_1 are similar to
one another.  In contrast, the posterior probability of \theta_4
changes dramatically.  The primary mode of AD 860 in the unconstrained
calibration shifts almost three centuries to AD 1150 in the Bayesian
calibration.  The 95% HPD region of the unconstrained calibration is
AD 380--1159; the long left tail of this distribution is anathema to
the ad hoc interpretation.  The 95% HPD region of \theta_4 in the
Bayesian calibration is AD 850-1619, a shift of some five centuries.
The relatively minor changes in the posterior probability of \theta_1
compared to those of \theta_4 are related directly to the standard
errors of the age estimates.  The standard error of Beta-83313 is 60
\rc\space years, about a quarter of the standard error of the age
determination for Beta-20852b.  The Bayesian calibration exploits the
lack of confidence in the age determination of Beta-20852b to produce
results that are archaeologically interpretable.

The chronological models developed in (\ref{eq:no-rat}) and
(\ref{eq:rat}) the BCal software package make it possible to estimate
the elapsed time between the colonization event and the archaeological
evidence for the introduction of the dated plants and animals that was
used as evidence of the post-colonization period.  Table
\ref{tab:introductions} shows the 67% HPD region for estimates of the
hiatus between colonization and the introduction of plants and animals
based on (\ref{eq:rat}).  The introduced materials fall into two
general categories.  The early introductions /R. exulans/ and
/A. moluccana/ arrived either with the first colonists or soon after
the initial colonization event.  In contrast, based on present
evidence, /I. batatas/, /A. altilis/, /L. siceraria/, and
/C. fruticosa/ all arrived later, some three to six centuries after
the colonization event.

The models of (\ref{eq:no-rat}) and (\ref{eq:rat}) can be extended to
measure the hiatus between the colonization event and other
archaeological events of interest.  One example is the hypothesis
formulated some years ago by
[[citet:graves95:_polyn_settl_of_hawaiian_archip]] that there was
likely to be a disparity between the Polynesian discovery of Hawai`i
and the earliest evidence of colonization recovered by archaeologists.
Using the model-based Bayesian calibration, a practical test of the
hypotheis with current data compares the Bayesian colonization date
estimate with the likely age of the earliest materials in the
\rc\space dates assembled by [[citet:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]].
These dates were selected as indicators of human activity and arguably
represent the full temporal range of activities reliably collected by
archaeologists.

The disparity between the earliest reliable indicator of human
activity and the Polynesian colonization event can be estimated by
adding a third period to either (\ref{eq:no-rat}) or (\ref{eq:rat})
and populating it with one or more \rc\space age determinations.  In
this case, the model (\ref{eq:rat}) was augmented by (\ref{eq:activity}).
Wk-19310 is the oldest \rc\space age determination in the most
reliable class established by the chronometric hygiene procedure [[citep:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn][Table
S1]] (see table \ref{tab:other-dates}).  It is a piece of
carbonized fern caudex collected from excavations at Site 4916 in a
sand dune near the mouth of Polol\=u Valley, Kohala, Hawai`i Island
[[citep:field08:_polol_valley_hawai_islan]].

The results of calibration with BCal [[citep:bcal]] indicate that, based
on the model and data of (\ref{eq:rat}) and (\ref{eq:activity}), the
67% HPD region for the disparity between the colonization event and
the first archaeological evidence of human activity is 110--369 years;
the 95% HPD region is 10--459 years (fig. \ref{fig:disparity}, /left/).

Perhaps the most practical uses of (\ref{eq:no-rat}) and
(\ref{eq:rat}) will be to supply an early bound for Bayesian
calibrations of cultural activity, especially at potentially early
sites  The Bellows Dune site was recently re-dated by
[[citet:dye10:_age_o18_site_hawaii]], who modeled the colonization
event as a normal curve centered at AD 800 and with a standard
deviation of 50 years.  It is interesting to ask whether the
colonization age estimate has an effect on the estimated age for
establishment of O18, and to estimate the hiatus between the
colonization event and establishment of the site.  This can be
accomplished by augmenting either (\ref{eq:no-rat}) or (\ref{eq:rat})
with (\ref{eq:o18}), which defines a new period with an early
boundary, \alpha_o18, and a late boundary, \beta_o18, and populating
it with the \rc\space age determinations on short-lived materials from
Layer III of the site (table \ref{tab:other-dates}).  Using
(\ref{eq:rat}) and calibrating with BCal yields a 67% HPD estimate for
site establishment of AD 1050--1209.  The slight differences between
this estimate and the estimate published by
[[citet:dye10:_age_o18_site_hawaii]] are due to the stochastic nature
of the calibration process; the estimate of site establishment was not
changed by the new estimate of the colonization event.  An estimate of
the hiatus between the colonization event and establishment of O18 is
50--249 years, using the 67% HPD (fig. \ref{fig:disparity}, /right/).

    :END:
The estimates of Polynesian colonization produced by the Bayesian
calibration are based on dated materials from the pre-colonization and
post-colonization periods.  Dated materials from the pre-colonization
period recovered by paleoenvironmental investigations yield a terminus
post quem for the colonization event.  \rc\space dates on materials
absent during the pre-colonization period and introduced to Hawai`i by
Polynesian colonists are unambiguously assigned to the
post-colonization period.  They yield a terminus ante quem for the
colonization event.  The Bayesian calibration, guided by an explicit
model that relates the dated events to the archaeological events of
interest, yields a probability distribution that indicates not only
when Hawai`i was colonized by Polynesians, but also the level of
confidence that one might reasonably have in the estimate.

Two calibrations, one with a potentially problematic date on an old
introduced rat bone from the `Ewa Plan and the other with \rc\space
dates on introduced flora, were run.  The calibration without the rat
bone date yields a conservative estimate of the uncertainty in the
analysis, with a 95% HPD region that spans almost five centuries.  The
additional information from the potentially problematic old rat bone
reduces the uncertainty of the estimate to slightly more than three
centuries.  As can be seen by comparing the shapes of the
distributions in Figure \ref{fig:no-rat}, the difference is primarily
at the late end of the estimate.  Adding the rat bone date yields a
probability distribution that is nearly symmetrical around its mode,
without the skewing apparent in the posterior probability of the
estimate based solely on floral remains.  Note that the early end of
the distribution changes very little with the addition of the rat bone
date and that the two estimates have very similar modes in the late
tenth century AD.  The reduction in uncertainty brought about by the
addition of the rat bone date, without much change in the central
tendency of the distribution, should hold more generally with the
addition of new \rc\space dating information.  Instead of the wide
swings in the estimates yielded historically by ad hoc procedures, a
model-based approach should yield increasingly precise estimates of
the colonization event around a stable center as new data become
available.

An advantage of model-based calibration over ad hoc interpretation of
\rc\space dating results is that relations between parameters of the
model are specified and can be interrogated directly.  Comparing the
earliest dated evidence for a variety of Polynesian introduced
materials supports traditional historical accounts of
post-colonization introduction of various cultivated plants
[[citep:handy72:native_planters][150--151, 189]].  The /kukui/ tree
and the Polynesian rat appear to have been introduced at the time of
colonization or very soon thereafter.  The other introduced
plants---sweet potato, gourd, breadfruit, and /k\=\i/---were, on
present evidence, introduced some three to six centuries later.  These
results offer some support for Green's hypothesis that sweet potato
and gourd were introduced to and spread throughout eastern Polynesia
together [[citep:green00:_range_discip_suppor_dual_origin]].  They
might have arrived in Hawai`i at about the same time as breadfruit and
/k\=\i/.

These results are heavily dependent on the few introduced materials
that have been dated; larger samples of dated Polynesian introductions
might well yield older dates.  Archaeologists should select sweet
potato, gourd, /k\=\i/ or other short-lived introduced material for
dating whenever possible.  It would also be worthwhile to date
additional Polynesian rat bones, taking care to control for the
possible influence of a marine component in the diet.  It is
potentially significant that rat bones from the lowest levels of the
sinkholes, which might be expected to yield the oldest dates, have not
been dated.

A decade ago, [[citet:tuggle01:_age_bellow_dune_site_o18]] observed
that archaeologists working in Hawai`i were not able to identify an
example of a colonization period site, and thus that there was a
disparity between the colonization event and the earliest reliably
dated evidence of cultural activity.  A few years earlier,
[[citet:graves95:_polyn_settl_of_hawaiian_archip]] argued that
evidence for the colonization period was likely to be difficult to
find, so that archaeologists should expect a disparity of this type.
Recently, the presence of a disparity has been disputed by archaeologists who
believe there is none.  [[citet:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]]
assert, without offering any counter argument, that the argument for
such a disparity is "no longer reasonable."  However, a comparison of
the colonization age estimate with the oldest material in their list
of purportedly reliable dates for human activity in Hawai`i indicates
a disparity of one to four centuries.  To the extent that the dates
assembled by [[citet:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]] actually reflect
the temporal range of confidently identified human activity in Hawai`i
[[citep:Mulrooney07062011,Wilmshurst07062011]], these results offer
support for the hypothesis that archaeologists in Hawai`i have not
managed to identify and reliably date cultural deposits associated
with the initial voyaging period of Polynesian colonization.
[[citet:kirchss:_when_did_polyn_settl_hawaii]] has taken a different
tack.  Based on an ad hoc estimate of the colonization event, he
suggests that archaeologists have found a colonization era deposit,
Layer III of the Bellows Dune site, O18.  On present evidence, the O18
site was established about a century before the earliest evidence
reported by [[citet:wilmshurst11:_high_east_polyn]], but it post-dates
the colonization event by about 200 years.  Colonization period sites
in Hawai`i should yield distinctive faunal assemblages, rich in the
remains of animals unable to sustain formerly large populations in the
face of human pressure, as elsewhere in Polynesia.  Such sites appear
to have escaped discovery in Hawai`i [[citep:dye-steadman90]].

** Graphics
This section contains two generic plotting routines that read
comma-separated-value files produced by the [[http://bcal.shef.ac.uk/top.html][BCal]] software package and
use [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]] to make publication quality plots.  One makes a plot of one or
more time intervals between two parameters, the other plots the
calibrated age of one or more events.  The plotting routines take
Org-mode tables as input.

** Notes
The notes here were accumulated as the project took shape over a
period of several months at the end of 2010 and early 2011.  Like most
notes, they were helpful at the time but seem somewhat cryptic several
months later.

*** A first-order model of Hawaiian cultural history
    - pre-human period, \alpha_1 = inf. bp., \beta_1
    - Polynesian period, \alpha_2 \beta_2 = 1778
    - recent period, \alpha_3 = 1778 beta_3 = today

*** Sources for pre-human period
    - Athens' cores, distinguished by lack of charcoal
    - Ordy Pond, two dates on a seed and one other sample, earliest
      calibrated to AD 777-1024 (midpoint AD 900)
    - See McDermott, Data Recovery for Barber's Point, for other rat
      bone dates.
    - Athens Shafter flats, Profile 1, layer VII has kukui nutshell,
      no kukui below this in section. (page 35)
    - Athens Shafter flats, pg. 45 of pdf has a useful list of
      introduced plants.
    - Pre-human dates from Shafter Flats are way early, not much help.
    - Athens Kawainui dates, Core B unit IV and lower are too old to
      be much help.
    - Kaloko, 1334-1408 cal bp, AD 542-616

*** Notes for Pre-human period
    - Age estimates for this period have been developed by
      paleoenvironmental studies, they were absent before this
    - How are pre-human contexts identified?

    - Pre-charcoal in cores from islands in the north without active
      vulcanism

    - "Pristine" pollen assemblages in cores from the southern islands

    - Lack of introduced fauna useful in places like Maha`ulepu
      where there were large excavations.

    - All of the contexts identified in these ways could have been
      laid down after settlement.  Their sensitivity to initial
      settlement hasn't been rigorously evaluated.

    - No problems with old wood on pre-human dates, it just makes
      them less useful, this is not an error to worry about

*** Notes for Polynesian period
      - No problems with old wood on Polynesian period dates, the
        things themselves are evidence, so no disjunction possible


/Artocarpus altilis/, the breadfruit, was introduced to Hawai`i by
Polynesians but has not become naturalized [[citep:wagner90][14]].

       10-180 years after colonization.  This suggests that
       palynological data not particularly sensitive to colonization
     - first-order v-6, turned on outlier probabilities for Polynesian
       dates.  These can be outliers if there are lab errors.  Deleted
       KAHO date because this is identified as pre-human based on
       "pristine" pollen criterion, which the PUHO data shows is not
       correct.

This page contains instructions for accessing the Bayesian
calibrations described in "A Model-based Age Estimate for Polynesian
Colonization of Hawai`i" by Thomas S. Dye.

*** Establish Account and Login

    - Send an email message to c.e.buck@sheffield.ac.uk with the
       subject =Dye Hawaii Colonization=.  If you do not have an
       account on the BCal server, you can leave the body of the
       message blank.  If you do have an account on the BCal server,
       and you would like the projects copied to a new subdirectory on
       that account, then put your BCal User code in the body of the
       email message.
    - You will receive an email reply with a notification that the
       projects have been copied and, if needed, the information
       required to login to an account set up for you on the BCal server
       (fig. \ref{fig:bcal-home}).

#+CAPTION: The BCal home page.  Note the Login and Tutorial menu selections.
#+LABEL: fig:bcal-home

[[file:bcal-main.png]]

    - Login to the BCal server with the User code and PIN/Password
       provided in the email reply (fig. \ref{fig:bcal-login}).

#+CAPTION: The BCal server user login.  Enter the User code and PIN/Password.
#+LABEL: fig:bcal-login

*** Access Calibration Projects
    - Go to the directory =Hawaii Colonization= by selecting it from
      the drop-down menu and pressing the =Change= button
      (fig. \ref{fig:bcal-cd}).

#+CAPTION: Change directory to =Hawaii Colonization=.
#+LABEL: fig:bcal-cd

[[file:bcal-cd.png]]

    - You will see four projects in the directory:
      =settlement-no-rat=, =settlement-with-one-rat=, =o18-layer-iii=,
      and =settlement-activity-disp-2= (fig. \ref{fig:bcal-4-files}).

#+CAPTION: Projects in the Hawaii Colonization directory.
#+LABEL: fig:bcal-4-files

[[file:bcal-3-files.png]]

*** Explore Results

    - Select the project of interest and press the =Results= button
      (fig. \ref{fig:bcal-results}).

#+CAPTION: The Results page for the =settlement-no-rat= project.
#+LABEL: fig:bcal-results

[[file:bcal-results.png]]

    - The left panel of Figure 1 in the paper can be reproduced by
      selecting =Individual Parameters= (fig. \ref{bcal-results}).
    - Check the box for the parameter =alpha post=
      (fig. \ref{fig:bcal-alpha-post}).
    - Scroll to the bottom of the window and press =Submit=.

#+CAPTION: Selection of =alpha post= from the parameters of the =settlement-no-rat= project.
#+LABEL: fig:bcal-alpha-post

[[file:bcal-alpha-post.png]]

    - View or modify the graph of the posterior probability
      distribution (fig. \ref{fig:bcal-graph}).

*** Experiment
Experiments are best carried out on copies of the original projects.
This way it is easy to get back to the starting point for a second
try, if necessary.

   - Make a copy of a project by pressing the =Copy= button
     (fig. \ref{fig:bcal-3-files}).
   - You can specify a project name (fig. \ref{fig:bcal-copy}).

#+CAPTION: Specify a new name for the copied project.
#+LABEL: fig:bcal-copy

[[file:bcal-copy.png]]

You can get an idea of how an experiment might work by comparing
projects in the =Hawaii Colonization= folder.  
   - The project =settlement-with-one-rat= was created by copying the
     project =settlement-no-rat= and adding one rat bone date to the post-colonization period.
   - The project =settlement-activity-disp-2= was created by copying
     the =settlement-with-one-rat= project and adding a third period.

The BCal Tutorial is a valuable resource.
